"""
Yusuf bought a few pieces of mats that rectangle in shape. All the mats have the same size. He wants to arrange the mats in a rectangle space, with conditions that the mats are not to be cut, folded, or overlapped.

Initially, Yusuf will fill in the available space by arranging the mat horizontally. If there is remainder space, he will arrange the mat vertically.

Given the measurement of the matâ€™s size and the space size to be used.
You are to determine the maximum number of mats that can be arranged by Yusuf.
